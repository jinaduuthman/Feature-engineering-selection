# Feature-engineering-selection
Often the data that we are given is not what we should feed into our model. So we might manufac- ture some new features from the data we have. And we might delete some irrelevant or redundant features. This is known as ”Feature engineering” and ”Feature selection”.

You are given data.csv which is, once again, real estate data that you will use to predict prices. There are five columns:
• property id Use this as the index of the dataframe.
• sqft hvac This is the square foot measurement of the interior of the house.
• lot width This is the width of the lot in feet.
• lot depth This is the depth of the lot in feet.
• age of roof This is the age of the roof in years.
• miles to school This is the number of miles to the nearest elementary school.
